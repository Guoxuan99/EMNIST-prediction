# EMNIST-prediction
2020/2021 sem 2 - Neural Network Individual Assignment Project - EMNIST prediction - Predict and evaluate the output of model trained using multiple MLP model created by using the EMNIST datasets.

Here are some of the sample shown in order to get a preview of how the EMNIST dataset is

Every image is given a label, and our task is to train different MLP model with different paramaters to get their responding result based on 
the accuracy of the predicted output and actual output
